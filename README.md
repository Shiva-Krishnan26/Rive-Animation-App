<h4 align="center">Came up with a new flutter rive project</h4>

This is a flutter app, where it have a stylish Bottom navigation bar and also a good looking Side menu Bar. This app also combined with rive Animation, which it comes with lot of options to design our app with animative way.i have animated icons attached with project that really make your app design stand out more.

So, what is really surprising about this is that i used animated assets, which means that these icon animations are not made in code. Instead, they're made in Rive which is a really cool animation tool that lets you create animated assets for your website, iOS, Android, and most importantly Flutter.
